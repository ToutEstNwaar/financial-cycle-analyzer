# utils/__init__.py

"""
Initialization file for the utils package.

This package will contain utility functions for the cycle indicator project,
such as plotting, data table creation, and saving results.
"""

# You can leave this file empty if you don't need to execute any package-level
# initialization code or define what's imported when 'from utils import *' is used.

# Example of how you might expose functions later (optional):
# from .plotting import plot_indicator_lines, create_cycle_table, save_indicator_data

# print("utils package initialized") # Optional: for confirming import
